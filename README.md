## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/saksham3232/JS.git
   cd JS
   ```

2. **Browse the folders**
   - Open any folder in your favorite code editor to explore the scripts and examples.
   - Read comments in code for explanations.

3. **Run JavaScript files**
